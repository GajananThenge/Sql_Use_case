# KPI's
# 1. %ACtive Users
High during June,July,August : might be due to summer Holidays. Demand is more in these months


# 2. Percentage of Completed Trips	Rejected Trips	Cancelled Trips
# Give an insight :
  Trip rejection Ratio is highest in Churned January,February,December


# 3. Churned Captain Rate: Churned Captain/(Active Captains +New Captains)
Churned Captain Rate is highest dunring Feb,July,Aug.



# 4. % of new Captians added.
# This will show expansion of employee numbers

Gradient Descent

Gradient Descent is most popular optimisation technique,used in machine learning and deep learning.
It can be combined with almost every algorithm to minimize errors or losses.

It is an optimization algorithm based on convex function that tweaks its parameters
iteratively to minimize a given function to its local minimum.

It simply calculate parameters or coefficient that minimize a cost function to its maximum extent.

During forward propagation, a series of calculations is 
performed to generate a prediction and to calculate the 
cost. The cost is a function that we wish to minimize.
In our case, the cost function will be:
